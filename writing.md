##### People today spend too much time on personal enjoyment -- doing things they like to do -- rather than doing things they should do.

Prosperity in economy is not the only characteristic of modern society in which individuals are given great freedom on their choice of life as well. Old generations have a strong tendency to put diligence, efforts and everything they they assume they 'should' do as priority in life, where I must disagree and argue that people have a concrete reason to attain more personal enjoyment.

Personal enjoyment is **among** the most efficient methods that release stress. People in modern societies which are often prospered but overpopulated, under fierce competitions, are confronted with various sources of stress such as employment, marriage and family. Recreational activities including hanging out, going to bars and being a couch potato offers people that are probably approaching even deeper depression with temporary relaxation, erasing their miserable memories or fear about the tough situation. ~~Study~~Investigation also shows that individuals have more favorable performance after entertainment. ~~In conclusion~~Therefore, personal enjoyment is one of the reasonable things that modern people 'should' do.

As I mentioned above, contemporary societies offer choice of life more than wealth, which implies that personal enjoyment can in turn become part of a job that brings considerable profit. Twitch, for instance, is a website with over a million active users broadcasting live when they play video games. The website makes enormous profit merely by inserting 10-second advertisement ahead of the streaming, part of which is fed back to the host as a reward or stimulus for better compositions. Some outstanding hosts have already made live streaming their primary job. In a sense, personal enjoyment inspires earnings in contemporary context.

**Admittedly**, It is universally acknowledged though that survival is so crucial that anything else can hardly matter without the basis of it, as a consequence of which a reasonable person is expected to commit virtually all his endeavor to it instead of idling around lost in overmuch leisure, for the sake of his life quality and even his offspring's. However, as time changes, modern societies have made it less costly for one to enter the middle class but relatively much harsher for a middle class to continue any further, not to mention countless tiny vexing problems one might encounter daily. It may after all be acceptable to pursue abundant happiness right now,  expanding the schedule for fun by an appropriate scale, rather than to chase joy far away in prospect, tortured.

In conclusion, people have the right and the necessity for a looser timetable where more personal enjoyment is arranged. **展望** It is expected as well that with the advancement of society, the proportion of leisure time should rise even more in the future.

##### :star: Life today is easier and more comfortable than it was then your grandparents were children.

The pursuit for happiness is one of the eternal topics along with the advancement of society, among which life quality has a great proportion of contribution to it. People today might be vexed by fiercer competition and stressed nerves at work, but it is hardly reasonable, from my perspective, that they complain about simplicity and convenience in modern life.

People today are enjoying manifold commodities and flourishing market. Our grandparents, as they constantly told us, lived a tough life as children. Chances were minor that they could have a meal with meat except near the end of a year, compared to us many of whom are suppressing the lure from a cheese burger by keeping a diet because meat is so approachable today that obesity becomes a matter of time with ignorance. Coke, Xbox, Macbook and everything you can name were never accessible or merely did not exist at that time, while modern people have to struggle between a Coke or a Pepsi at the grocery. It is such a comfort to live in contemporary world where it is always a multiple choice before the shelf.

Daily routines are getting extremely painless nowadays. Thanks to enormous advancement in data science and information technology as well as businesses with acute foresight, various optimization has been brought from theory to real life intended to accelerate or totally replace those tedious tasks that may have been torturing ordinary people for decades. ~~Our grandparents~~Previous people probably never imagined in their youth that they can contact with friends who are thousands miles away with live face chat, just like in person, while our generation has long taken ultrafast 4G cellular telecommunication for granted. They would not, definitely, ever expected that they would wait at home in cosiness for packages to arrive at their door automatically that contain the refrigerator ordered online yesterday or even takeaway dinner prepared a moment ago in an adjacent restaurant. It is therefore never exaggerated that daily life today is hundreds of times superior to the past.

Modern individuals have much more control over the course of life. Prosperity in economy and liberation in mind grant modern people the privilege of deliberate neglect over others' interference which usually poses stress on one's nerves. Our grandparents, however, were incessantly instructed to be cautious about if their words and behavior were consistent with orthodox ideology, unfortunately compelled to waste considerable energy on responding prudently towards gossip, not to mention that marriage or even an intimate relation without approval from parents was considered dissolute. People today, contrarily, have been virtually rid of the countless trivial constraints mentally and physically, attaining  independence in choice of life.

**Overall**, People seem to complain about air quality and stress at work sometimes, expressing an inclination for life in the old days. However, if they were really given the chance to go back, they would, from my perspective, hesitate, mute and joking. After all, modern life is so simpler and has so much more to enjoy.

##### Some people say that the Internet provides people with a lot of valuable information, Others think access to much information creates problems.

Internet is undoubtedly one of the greatest inventions throughout history, allowing unimaginably enormous volume of information to flow globally at an incredible velocity. Despite its irreplaceable convenience, people are pervasively concerned about its negative side, which, from my perspective, hardly overweighs the correspondents.

Easy transfer of giant amount of information on the Internet enables great possibilities. These possibilities are contributing to extents including optimization of daily routines, academic communication and knowledge pervasion. Thanks to the web, people are able to shop online on websites like Amazon, make payment afterwards with a credit card and wait in cosiness for free delivery instead of driving a pickup for miles for a new television. Before the era of the Internet, academic journals were only accessible in paper print version, usually in an annual bundle, which greatly constrained scientists from acknowledging latest research frontier, while scientists today are accustomed to automatically updated notification on newly published articles, not to mention that even those extremely aged publications composed when computer was not invented have largely been digitalized with optical character recognition technology. Wikipedia, Stackoverflow and many other sites are definitely replacing cumbersome conventional encyclopedias, doing a superior job in spreading knowledge to the public.

Internet, where everyone has a right to express ideas, is an extended realm of consensual democracy that pushes mass media and government towards transparency. It has been long suspected in conspiracies that the media are assisting government to conceal dirty truths from the mass who have the natural tendency to trust newspapers and television. On the Internet, however, a tiny scandal spreads so swiftly that it jeopardizes a company or a government overnight. Even if a government is dominant enough to erase every records on the newspapers and mute every television channel, millions of inconspicuous forums in the corners of the web keep the stains for decades to come. Public organizations, consequently, are facilitated to be trustworthy and reasonable, providing rich transparent information about their work process. Those priceless information on the Internet, undoubtedly, promotes less corrupt societies.

It is, however, a prevailing opinion that the giant volume of data online is a source of trouble, where personal privacy, as people are widely concerned, is somehow threatened, and fluctuation in society might increase, challenging the authority of governments. Fair as all of these concerns are, the preponderance of information boom, from my perspective, can never be exaggerated or considered inferior to the trouble it causes since it has generally served a good purpose so far and later artificial intelligence driven by deep learning theory and, certainly, enormous set of data is extensively anticipated to tackle many of contemporarily unsolvable problems.

In conclusion, the Internet is generally positive when it comes to the huge amount of valuable information it offers. **展望** It is anticipated, from my perspective, that the value of Internet is going to be appreciated by

##### Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? In order for a business to be successful, it must put more money into advertising.

Walking down the street, chances are minor that no advertisement is inside your sight. For decision makers in marketing department of almost any company, it seems an external question whether sufficient budget has been arranged for advertising. A successful modern company, at least from my perspective, ought to have abundant proportion of ~~budget~~investment intended for advertising.

Advertising is imperative to production under modern context. In order for a firm to be successful, production must increase which is virtually equivalent to appealing to more customers to your brand. Public awareness, consequently, is essential, as it determines the number of potential patronizers where advertising is obviously the most swift and painless approach to get people acknowledged, not to mention that contemporary market is extremely saturated where virtually any realm of product or service is somehow covered by some company, or it is even much more likely that several companies providing seemingly identical services are competing fiercely for dominance. In this case, advertising is literally the last solution.

Advertising facilitates formation of public relations. A successful company nowadays no longer dominates the market on it own. Rather, it accompanied with an alliance that rules the market together. Advertising is definitely ~~useful~~favorable in building relations with pioneers in other fields. Movie stars, for instance, are frequently invited to filming television commercials as they allure millions of ~~their~~ fans, and thus a relation with the celebrity can be established for the sake of future cooperations. Apple, for example, ~~often~~constantly introduces their products such as iPhone and iPod in special red edition in cooperation with Product Red, a global non-profit fund that aims at eliminating AIDS, to promote its commitment to charity. **Nike, Starbucks and many other lead-takers follow the same practice as well.** People nowadays are expecting to see commercial companies assuming social responsibilities and possessing noble senses like being environmentally friendly and being sympathetic for Africa, where advertising is a must to cultivate people's homage towards the brand by notifying people the endeavor.

Admittedly, the quality and honesty should always rank top in evaluating a business. It had long been a prevailing opinion that a company with fine products do not need advertising which was considered all fraud. However, as economy booms, market is getting saturated, fulfilled with competitive identical service providers, while people are losing patience. After all, it takes considerable much more vigor to identify fine quality and laudable companies that do not advertise than to make do with the commodities appearing in an advertisement that works fine.

In conclusion, it is reasonable to put more budget on advertising for the sake of future success and dominance. With the advancement of society as well as increase in people's demand for commercial morality, its proportion is bound to rise yet again.

##### Movies and television have more negative effects than positive effects on the way young people behave.

> More study, more data.

Mass media of the new generation like movies and television are so prevailing that they have already jeopardized conventional media such as newspapers and magazines. When people hold the pervasive opinion about their preponderance, it is, from my perspective, undeniable that these new dynamic media are imposing more negative impact on the behavior of the juvenile and the young than ever.

Movies and television are so time-consuming that the young generations invest considerable time into them. Movies, for instance, are transiently shown in cinema for a very short period of time, as a consequence of which movie-lovers -- mainly the young -- have to fulfill the cinema, pausing their task of study. Televisions, again, requires even more time than movies because TV stations are so flourishing nowadays that it never hurts to find a live program at any time of a day appealing to a teenager's taste. Contrarily, conventional media like newspapers allow one to pick them up and consume whenever it is convenient for one and to drop them and head for tasks whenever time is up. Due to the transient nature of movies and television, the young generations are losing patience, dedication and the sense of categorizing tasks into various ~~superiorities~~priorities, as nothing would prevent them shifting away concentration from their current job when their favorite TV shows are presenting.

The impact from the content of modern media, however, is even more grievous. As economy booms and society advances, movies and televisions are seeking their way through this massive recreational atmosphere, by producing less nutritious compositions with as much entertainment, luxury and stimulus as possible to meet the appetite of contemporary audience who, after yet another exhausting day at work, hopes to release stress. When these contents reach teenagers, they become inappropriate, misleading the young who have probably never truly stepped into realistic society yet to believe that what is presented on the show is what they will see in reality. Consequently, the young generations have a tendency to imitate the unfavorable behavior of the stars in the compositions such as brute language and radical emotion which are likely to be exaggerated for the sake of better rendering or simply ratings.

Admittedly, movies and televisions are excellent media that have been doing an splendid job since the very start of their inventions at pervading novel knowledge and ideas to the public. Moreover, they are gradually being considered new forms of art under modern context. However, due to lack of grading mechanism for long and people's weak consensus on their negative effects, movies and televisions are doing more damage to their behavior inside out than ever imagined. In conclusion, emphasis must be placed on guiding teenagers to identify the good part.

##### :star: Do you agree or disagree: today advertising is less honest than it was in the past, for that reason it is less useful for people to choose what they want to buy.

> More data.

The reliability of advertisements has been doubted since the very start of its invention dated back thousands of years ago. As the economy booms in recent decades, substantial advertisements by virtually every company in the world has been flourishing, obscuring our sight everywhere, when their dependability is under heated discussion again. Modern advertisements, from my perspective, are truly less trustworthy in conveying concrete message about the product and guiding people's choice than it used to be and there are several reasons that follow.

Competition in market is getting more acute. Prosperity in economy has granted people a multiple choice in front of the shelf at the grocery, as well as a saturated market where multiple companies provide identical products or services. In this case, companies are expelled to exaggerate in their advertising techniques to appeal to swinging customers to their brand. Coca Cola, for instance, put their single paged advertisement on magazines in the 1950s with only an image of a vivid glass of Coke spanning across the whole page and a big title before it, at which time Pepsi was perceived hardly able to survive. Not until 1980s, however, Pepsi recovered from an inch away aside extinction and suddenly possessed over 15% of the market share, did Coca Cola set out to promote dynamic television commercials, in which fantasies with exaggeratively vigorous shots were taking place. Even today Coca Cola's advertisements still inherit its aged conventions, rendering its capabilities of suppressing thirstiness as much as possible while it is universally acknowledged that Coke contains so much sugar that it can only make you feel even thirstier.

People are generally powerless towards fraud advertising. Prudent advertisers are accustomed to a tiny tag at the corner of a poster or display that says 'for reference only' so that it usually avoids potential accusation towards its unfaithfulness, let alone that the majority would rather see the product themselves than trust an advertisement without any motive of charge, as a consequence of which modern advertisements generally are in charge of cultivating public awareness towards a specific brand more than convincing people. Moreover, unless one suffers from great loss due to dishonesty of an advertisement so that he is forced to argue against the brand representatives at court, considerable energy and fare are giant obstacles between victims and justice.

Admittedly, advertising remains a trustworthy source of potential costumers and a bunch of companies that believe in quality and regular costumer satisfaction are persistently cautious at advertising even nowadays. It is, unfortunately though, undeniable that posters and television commercials turn out tedious ornament that are either everywhere on the street or notifying viewers to refill their beverage before their favorite TV shows.

In conclusion, advertising functioning as dependable origins of commodities is disappearing, replaced by its greater function as public awareness raiser and a piece of fine arts that best transfers the noble philosophy of the brand. It is anticipated that as society advances, advertisements will continue to be even lovelier before eyes but less faithful in mind.

##### :calendar: Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Educating children is a more difficult task today than it was in the past because they spend so much time on cell phone, online games, and social networking website.

Generation gaps exist between every two generations in reality, but it was not until the very recent that gaps between the latest two generations seem so considerably enlarged, with increasing complaints from parents that education becomes a tough task which in my opinion is a truth. However, distractions like the prevailing smart phones and online games, on which the majority of parents blame for their children being untamable, from my perspective, hardly count as the primary reason.

Education is getting increasingly costly nowadays. Prosperity in economy has granted virtually every family the pervading basic education at an affordable price, while premium education that enables children to develop a more solid knowledge base remains a scarce kind of resource beyond the reach of common middle-class families. Driven by the uncontrollable desire to cultivate more successful descendants in order to facilitate future opportunities for the family to move up in society, parents are compelled to pay as heavily  as in a gamble for upgraded education that aims more at inspiring children's potential talents. After all, that strong desire originates largely from middle-class parent's anxiety in hoping to preserve the family's social status in a society that is anticipated to be more fiercer in competition.

Education is hurting children, so they have to rebel in some ways. Education nowadays is not any longer as simple as countable subjects like maths and language. Children are expected to be skillful at literally everything, from dancing to playing a musical instrument. Deep in their heart, the amusement park or a family picnic accompanied with parents and friends is where they belong, rather than these tedious courses. However,

However, these distractions would never really matter, if children were otherwise engaged in the activities that appeal to them, without unfavorable after-school courses.

According to the reading material, the author claims that providing employees with an optional 4-day weekday policy will increase company's profit, reducing unemployment rate and raise employees' life quality, whereas the professor in the listening material rebuts this point, arguing that the policy will hardly live up to the three expectations.

The professor refutes the viewpoint demonstrated in the reading passage that companies can profit more with employees who are better rested and less likely to make errors at work by offering the shortened weekday policy, ~~by stating~~and states that companies in the contrary have to spend more in hiring more employees who in turn cost the company even more for offering extra training, medical care, office spaces and new devices like computers.

The reading passage claims that the policy is expected to create new jobs thus it brings down the unemployment rate, which is completely opposed in the listening where the professor says that the policy will drive companies to make its employees work overtime to compensate the cost in hiring new workers, and to raise its expectation for staff possibly by compressing the time arranged for a task that normally takes 5 days into 4 days, as a consequence of which no more job will be created and thus unemployment rate will not drop.

It is also proposed in the passage that thanks to the policy, individuals will be given better life quality since they have more time for rest and recreation. However, as argued in the lecture, their life quality would drop instead of rising since the policy will damage their job stability, making 4-day employees vulnerable to losing jobs in an economic crisis. Employees who enjoy the shortened weekdays also confront less job advancement and fewer promotion opportunities since companies hope their management positions should be occupied by people who work longer.

According to the reading material, the author casts doubt on the accuracy of Chevalier's memoir, whereas the professor in the listening material rebuts these doubts and state that abundant evidence is available to prove its trustworthiness.

The passage says that chances were minor that Chevalier was a rich man since he wrote that he had to borrow money from his merchant friends. However, as explained in the lecture, Chevalier was quite wealthy in terms of his possession rather than cash, and it was because it often took a few days at that time for him to convert his possession to cash by selling them out that he had to borrow some cash from his friends during those days.

It is doubted in the passage that conversations between Chevalier and Voltaire are by no means reliable because by the time ~~when~~ the book was written, those conversations had already happened before many years and it was not likely that Chevalier remembered so clearly about every exact detail of them. Contrarily, the professor refutes it by saying that Chevalier took notes every night after his conversation with Voltaire, and when he was writing the memoir, he referred to many of his notes which he kept with care for long as well as journals, so it is not surprising that he could recollect every detail and put it in his memoir.

The author of the passage also argues that Chevalier escaped from prison in Venice by bribing his friends in the government rather than breaking the prison on his own as described in his memoir, which again is opposed by the lecture. Bribes hardly worked, as the professor says, since other prisoners who had much greater gangs of political friends did not manage to escape from prison by bribing either. More evidently, according to the contemporary government records, the ceilings of the particular prison from which Chevalier escaped were reported to be repaired after he escaped.

According to the reading passage, 'let it burn' policy is considered by the author to be destructive and that it should no longer be approved after the big fire in Yellowstone in 1988 for it imposed great damage to vegetation, wildlife and tourism, whereas the listening material refutes this point, arguing that these impacts were minor.

The passages says the fire caused huge damage beyond imagination to trees and other vegetation. However, as stated in the lecture, the fire enabled new vegetation to grow and replace previously dominant species, promoting diversity. For example, big trees were obliterated and replaced by small trees. Besides, some seeds would not germinate in absence of heat.

As for wildlife, it is supposed in the passage that wildlife population were largely threatened since many animals were unable to flee from the fire and the food chain balanced throughout years was completely destroyed. Contrarily, the lecture challenges it by saying that wildlife population recovered quickly after the fire, and an even stronger food chain was established since vegetation like small trees offers shelter for small animals like rabbits and hares which appealed to more predators.

The lecture also refutes the viewpoint demonstrated in the passage about Yellowstone's tourism being damaged and local economy dependent on tourism being threatened since the fire erased virtually all tourist attractions. It is argued that 1988 fire was so rare that fire in similar size never took place again afterwards, not to mention that large number of tourists soon came back following the next year and local tourism recovered to previous level.

According to the reading material, the author cast doubt on the trueness that the Greeks used large mirrors to set Roman ships on fire in order to defend themselves, whereas the professor in the listening material opposes this, arguing that it could actually happen.

It is stated in the passage that ancient Greeks did not possess the technology to build such a huge mirror with a few meters in radius and with an eligible geometric shape in good precision so that it concentrates sunlight. However, the professor argues that the Greeks had the technology to build small and flat polished mirrors and could assemble them to a large approximated curve so it could still work without the need to manufacture the mirror as an integrated sheet, not to mention that the contemporary Greek mathematicians already knew the maths required to put the mirrors into the right positions.

The reading passage says that according to an experiment it is anticipated that it would take a few minutes to inflame a Roman warship that remains still, let alone in reality Romans would never make their ships unmoved. Contrarily, the professor challenges this by saying that it might be inefficient to inflame the wooden parts on the ships but there was components installed on the ships that could catch a fire in seconds and spread easily to wood.

The reading material also argues that the Greeks could use flaming arrows which were a much more common and effective solution to set the enemy ships on fire rather than a mirror, which is again refuted by the professor who claims that Roman soldiers were so familiar with this that they were well prepared for flaming arrows, putting the fire they would cause as soon as they land, while fire caused by the reflected light ray were uneasy to notice, since light ray is invisible, therefore it would be surprising for the Romans when they discovered fire on the ships.

##### :pencil: It is more enjoyable to have a job where you work only three days a week for long hours than to have a job where you work five days a week for shorter hours.

Weekdays are so tedious that people nowadays are even proposing a four-day or three-day weekday policy, stating that in order for more days in the weekend stretched weekdays are tolerable. With the overall work-time remaining persistent, I, however, would still prefer to work five days a week with less hours for one-day work.

An appropriate length of work-time is essential to efficiency at work. It is always difficult for one to keep his concentration for a long period of time, whether for students in class or employees at work, let alone to have his mind operate at constant efficiency. Various investigations have shown that people's speed of solving problems dramatically drops after an hour of intense thinking and people start to feel sleepy, from which point of time it will be quite harmful for one's health. It is obviously unreasonable and unenjoyable from the perspective of long term for one to trade two extra days for entertainment and rest with the sacrifice of his own health which is almost equivalent to his happiness in late life.

The majority of people are sticking to five-weekday policy. It might be comfortable for only you to shift to three-weekday policy as soon as possible. However, in those two days which you have spared with tiresome long hours of work in the previous three days, most of your friends and family members are probably working. The varied timetables bring so much conflict and collision that it will be only those who have chosen three-weekday policy like you that you can possibly hang out with. Contrarily, if you stick to the old-fashioned policy, you can have all the seven evenings and nights in a week for leisure with friends and families, instead of envying others in the two evenings when you work or idling in loneliness during the two extra weekend days.

Admittedly, three-weekday policy has its edges. For those whose workplaces are far away from home and whom it takes several hours to commute between them, the revolutionary policy will cut down the time wasted on the way greatly. However, considering the impact that long intense hours of work will have on health as well as the timetable conflicts which has been discussed above, more weekdays with shorter hours at work is much more preferable even though it means waking up early for two mornings.

According to the reading material, the author presents three theories that can possibly explain quackers, whereas in the listening material the professor denies all of the three theories.

It is said in the passage that it might be the orca whales that made these sounds since their sound is considered, based on extensive studies on orcas, very similar to what the submarines detected. However, it is refuted by the professor who says that orcas mainly live on the surface of the ocean so that it was unlikely that submarines which stay deep in the water, far away from the surface, could detect their sounds, not to mention orcas are detectable by sonar.

The passage gives an explanation that giant squids caused these sounds since squids do not have skeleton, making them undetectable by sonar. Contrarily, the professor challenges this opinion by stating that quackers were frequently received between 1960s and 1980s and quackers suddenly disappeared in the late 1980s, while squids are known to **have been living** in that area ~~at all time~~all the time.

It is also claimed in the reading material that quackers might come from secret foreign submarines equipped with anti-sonar technology, which is again opposed by the professor who says that quackers' patterns implied that its origins were changing direction so swiftly that no contemporary submarines could do that. Moreover, when quackers were detected, no engine noise was sensed simultaneously, but even nowadays, no submarines can avoid engine noise being detected.

:star: Old generations tend to attach great hope to young generations, expecting them to impose giant influence on driving the whole society towards positive direction. To their disappointment though, young people do not seem to take the lead when it comes to the important decisions of society, at least from the perspective of a considerable number of people, where I must oppose and argue that the young do have impact on society and its future.

Young generations lead society in an unnoticeable and indirect manner. People nowadays do not have to sit in a government to make important decisions and the authorities are compelled to absorb abundant suggestions from society to make reasonable decisions that are acceptable for the majority. The market, which is a huge part of society, is what governments must favor on a large scale and is usually where young generations have dominant and decisive forces. China, for example, has recently granted Sony Corporation the privilege to sell its well-received PlayStation 4 game console publicly in China mainland, after retreating the ban on video games and game consoles which had lasted for almost two decades. It is the outcry from young generations who mostly support legalization of sale of games and take up virtually a total proportion of video game customers that forces the government to change its mind.

Young generations have extraordinary creativity. As society advances and economy booms, things may not work as it had for the past years, while old generations, due to the era in which they were born and raised, have confined and unvarying thinking when confronted with contemporary innovations that are expected to completely change the world. Contrarily, young generations, more open-minded, are easy to accept difference, which helps them build creative thinking that is more consistent with modern world. Were it not for the young who is seemingly radical from the viewpoint of the old, fashion, architecture and industrial design would never proceed at such a fast pace challenging prevailing concept towards clothes, buildings and cell phones. **具体实例** **总结**In terms of creativity, compared to the old, young generations have a vital impact on the course of some realms of society.

Admittedly, old generations have their edges over the young in their objective and moderate way of considering and viewing and it is undeniable that they have contributed much to the creation of modern society in which the young were raised. However, it is juvenile and naive for some senior citizens to presume that the young have little influence on the course of society simply based on the small proportion of young staff in the government. It is a truth though that governments are gradually losing the ability to appeal to the young, but young generations are truly transforming every important aspect of society.

**结尾**In conclusion, youngster are already imposing their influence on those important decisions of society in their own manner, and it is expected that they will continue exerting this irreplaceable/indispensable influence in the future.

##### Some parent offer their school-age children money for each high grade(mark) they get in school. Do you think this is a good idea?

> 不要强行用定语从句。

:star: As competitions become fiercer in school, parents are coming up with every possible method in order to boost their children's performance in tests, some of whom even give them money as a reward of high grade, which has raised an acute discussion. This practice, from my perspective, is not preferable though as it does no good to children.

Money is hardly a good stimulus that can encourage children incessantly. Using money as stimulus might be useful and effective for the first or second time, as it enables children to harvest great joy in possessing the freedom to purchase whatever they wish. However, chances are that children gradually take this reward for granted and no longer view it as a reward. More severely, once their performance in tests decreases accidentally, they are given less money or are even ~~cut off~~deprived of this joy, which imposes great stress on children because they desperately desire the freedom back~~, as a consequence of which~~. Consequently, they probably do even worse in the next test. As time passes, money, as a stimulus, forms a negative feedback loop, witnessing children performing less and less satisfyingly.

Giving money as reward distorts children's ~~concept of money~~financial thinking. Money is a relatively ambiguous concept for children at school, while a good grade in a test basically deserves no money paying back as a reward since getting good performance in a test might mean a lot to the exam-takers but it does not create contribution to society nor provide others with useful service. In essence, money was invented as a alternative that represents the average efforts taken in making contribution to society. If parents give money reward, they are equivalently indicating to their children that there is a plausible connection between a good grade and getting paid by money, which is certainly setting a false notion of money in children's mind. As a consequence, whenever children are deprived of money reward due to bad performance, they become so desperate that they might come up with devil thoughts such as outcrying for money or even stealing money from parents.

Admittedly, money as a reward is an enormously effective stimulus for the first few weeks and a sudden and huge rise in children's grades is expected soon since money, representing their favorite toys or a palatable meal at their favorite restaurant, is such a giant lure that few children decide not to work hard, submerged in the fantasy. However, as stated above, using money as a stimulus trades children's performance with their moral senses, jeopardizing their future. In conclusion, it is never a good idea to offer money as a reward.

According to the reading material, the author presented three reasons to oppose that Sinosauropteryx was feathered, whereas the professor in the lecture refutes all the three reasons, stating that abundant evidence exists that can prove it was feathered.

The reading passage says the fine lines were probably formed after the dinosaur's death and were not any structure on its body. However, the professor disagrees this by saying that other animals buried at the same time and discovered in the same site do not have these lines on them, not to mention that according to the condition of the remains of other animals excavated, volcanic ash shows an excellent ability to preserve these remains well.

It is claimed in the reading that even if these fine lines were not from decomposition and came from part of the dinosaur, they could be frills rather than feathers. Contrarily, the professor argues that feathers and frills have difference in terms of their chemical composition and some special kind of protein that exists in feathers but not in frills was detected in these fine lines.

It is also stated in the passage that feathers might not be necessary to a dinosaur in terms of flying or regulating body temperature according to the location of the lines, which is again opposed by the professor who says feathers could have other functions such as display function which for example many birds use to attract mates.

Prosperity in modern society has provided people with enormous abundance of materials, technologies and cultures that brings huge diversity as well as convenience to life, whereas it is indeed an undeniable truth that people nowadays do not feel so happy as before. Some people hold the opinion that it is the unprecedentedly fast pace at which the whole world is changing that causes dissatisfaction, where I must disagree and argue that other reasons should be considered more decisive than it.

People simply desire more. It is probably seemingly unreasonable for modern civilians to possess the idea of desiring since convenience has almost reached its ceiling where daily routines cannot be optimized any further. However, as economy booms, literature, movie and many other forms of mental civilization are flourishing, enabling people to hold more fantasy and imagination about what their ideal life should be. The gap between fantasy and reality obviously creates void in their mental well-being, lowering their sense of fulfillment. Comparatively, back in the old days when society was not well developed, people were so occupied, struggling for survival being their superior task, which spared no room for imagination, that people became content as long as when they had meat served for a meal.

Inequality ~~is increasing~~is more serious than before. It is said that lack is less fearful than inequality, implying that inequality is a huge obstacle between people and the feeling of happiness. Various investigations with delicately designed experiments that took place among university students have shown that compared to the absolute amount of value or property one owns, others' amount of personal possession is of more concern to ordinary people, indicating that compared to one's own life quality level, people care more about whether they enjoy the same level of well being as others.

Admittedly, the enormously fast pace at which change takes place is imposing stress onto people, especially the old generations who is afraid of being rid off the mainstream of society from time to time. Moreover, the direction of change is often vague and unclear, challenging people's faith in morality which they hope they can hold permanently. However, since the speed is unstoppable at least in the predictable future, our focus should shift onto those problems like mental fulfillment and social inequality that shock people's satisfaction, rather than trying to hamper development of society in vain.

##### :pencil: When teachers assign projects on which students must work together, the students learn much more effectively than when they are asked to work alone on projects.

There has always been a discussion among educators about whether to favor collaborative or solo projects. They both have their own unique and irreplaceable preponderance under various context, but collaborative assignment, from my perspective, is more favorable than its independent counterpart in most cases.

Collaboration accelerates students' speed at which they absorb knowledge. Compared to independent project, collaborative projects add transfer of information to the process. In a conventional solo project, a student do all the work on his own. With everything done, he waits for the feedback from the teacher, which might take a few days to review the result. Apart from the delay that might hamper the student from recollecting details and gathering experience learned in the project, students hardly share their work with each other to possess an objective perspective on their own composition. Various investigations have shown that compared to their senior generations, people tend to accept suggestions from their own generations more sincerely. To conclude, working together boosts students' potential in receiving novel knowledge.

Efficient collaboration is brought as a vital skill to students during group projects. Modern scientific research findings more rarely depend on single individuals' outstanding intelligence, where collective wisdom in the form of scientific groups and laboratories that consist of hundreds of scientists is replacing traditional single scientists like Einstein and Thomas Young, becoming dominant forces in achieving new breakthroughs. Consequently, as a modern individual, collaboration is fundamental and collaborative projects are perfect occasions to train this vital skill. During collaboration, students learn how to express himself, listen to others' opinions and eventually evolve a consensus that is well proved and viable. Contrarily, students may neglect the discrimination and prejudice he brings in, hardly capable of gradually cultivating critical thinking.

Admittedly, working on a project together is much more time-consuming than doing a solo project, both for teachers as reviewers and students as participants, since without proper instructions on effective cooperation, it takes time and numerous practice for the students to figure out a good way to fit in a team and to communicate with efficiency. However, from the perspective of long-term effects, proceeding collaborative projects enables students to fit in modern society better, which overweights personal wisdom under contemporary context.

In conclusion, working as a group in a project has so many dominant edges over working alone. As economy advances with society's call for more collaboration, collaborative projects are expected to be more acceptable by more educators.

##### :pencil: To improve the quality of education, universities should spend money on salaries of university professors.

It has long been a phenomenon that university professors complain about their low salary while everybody else in society do not think they deserve so much. For the sake of university education quality, university professors, from my perspective, is worth higher salaries.

High salaries free professors from distractions. It is very common for university professors who are hardly satisfied with the number they are payed to do some 'part-time job' such as working as a consultant in a company whose realm is relevant to his research interest, or participating in reviewing test papers in annual college entrance examination. These jobs, however, are huge distractions that shift away a great proportion of professors' concentration at teaching and instructing students. Moreover, professors are competing fiercely for superior titles with which one gets paid more. If high salaries are present, a large number of professors will be content with his income and focus virtually all his vigor onto educating and improving his classes. Consequently, the quality of education can thus advance.

Talents from all academic realms will be fascinated to enter universities for career. There is currently hardly any motivation for one to steel his will to be a professor, except his own substantial interest in a particular field of research or the relatively high social status with fancy titles as a university professor. As a consequence, the intellectuals, once they get their master degree or doctor degree, flee away from university to commercial companies or startups, even risking themselves being unemployed in such a saturated human resource market. It is investigated that throughout the US, instead of professors, football coaches get the highest pay over all staff in a university. Were there reasonably higher salaries for the teaching positions, elites from all around the society would be willing to come to universities with their most advanced industrial experience gained throughout years of practice to share with students.

Admittedly, to nourish a university with decent quality of undergraduate or graduate education, many other measures can also be considered to take, such as partitioning more budget for teaching materials like projectors and classroom facilities. However, there is no other action that is more efficient than raising professors' satisfaction at their job since they are the fundamental forces as well as the true soul that makes up a university and spreads knowledge. In conclusion, as economy booms ~~and~~with society's call for improved higher education, professors will be given more reverence and correspondingly high salaries that fit their contribution.
